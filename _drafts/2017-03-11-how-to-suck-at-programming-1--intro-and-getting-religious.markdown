People often ask me how to be a good programmer. It's not an easy or simple answer to that question.  
I do know very clearly how to __suck at programming__.

So I tend to approach the subject with the so called _via negativa_.  
By subtraction.

__Don't be a sucker.__

Its not always clear what is the best way of doing something, but easy to identify what's horrible.

Think of it as a risk management strategy, capping your losses.

It has been shown in many studies __we feel double the intensity for negative stimuli than for positive__.  
This effectively means you are going to feel (at least) twice as horrible for each mistake than you feel good for hitting the bullseye.

If you lose 100 euros it hurts a lot more than winning 100 euros.

It's also something that with the years I started thinking to myself,  
most of the things I would learn in a job was __how not to do something__.

It's important. It's critical.

When you see something going terrible and you facepalm at it, __you need to learn not to repeat it__.

So after all, I'm still not sure I qualify to people's concept of a great programmer,  
__but I certainly learned how not to suck at programming__.

Without further ado, let's start the series to teach you how to be a horrible programmer.  

Introducing the series

#How to suck at programming

## Episode #1 - Get Religious

Now of course, I couldn't start with any other lesson than this one.

This is my favourite, and also, the most practiced way of how to suck.  
And I've done my share of wrongings here.

What do I mean by _Get Religious_ ?

It has nothing to do with religion per se.

This occurs when a method, technology or way of doing something __is considered the best almost in a holy way__, and one defends it like their lives depend on it.

When people use superlatives and words like __never, always, impossible__.  
In fact people use those words I feel a little tingling in my stomach.

And this epiphany came of course from my stupid attitude towards Operational Systems.

It went something like this:

I used to hate Windows.  
Then I started using Linux and loved it.
Then I hated on Linux and would praise Windows.
Then I thought Macs were total shit and overprice.
Then I had to work on Macs and I loved it.

Here is the thing.

In software (and in life really) __solutions are often opinions__, and things typically have both __good and bad aspects__ to them __at the same time__.

That's why __having a strong opinion__ about subjects is a good thing, but __getting religious__ about them is not.  

It is a certainly healthy to __think mac is the best choice for your use case__, or to think that __Ubuntu server is the best choice for your server__.

But it is certainly a sucker who thinks something is __always__ the best choice for __all__ use cases.

So __getting religious about software__ is guaranteed way of sucking.

Of course, also, this is the case for programming languages and frameworks.  
And text editors and IDEs.

And Linux distros.

And a lot of other things.

So remember, want to suck at programming ?

__Get religious about software.__
