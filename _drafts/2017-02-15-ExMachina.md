# exMachina - The Test Data Generator Freak

When you are going to test your Elixir app, it is very useful to have data that emulate your system usage.

In other words, __test data that looks like production data__.

Yeah sure, you can also do that from scratch and ExUnit but exMachina makes it more pleasant.
Life is about pleasantries. C'mom.
