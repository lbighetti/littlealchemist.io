Hi.

My name is Leandro Bighetti, I'm a programmer.

And I believe Elixir is a great language.

Over the previous 6 years I was a Java Developer, and I had the opportunity to work in one of the largest investment banks in the world, and also in a very profitable game studio startup.

Currently, I'm working in a Berlin start-up, and I'm using Elixir on a daily basis.

I'm creating this blog to show other developers the power of Elixir and also to aid whowever is using it already to achieve great things.

## Why should you listen to me ?

You see, I put my money where my mouth is.

Elixir pays my rent and food.

I bring you the histories of every day real life of Elixir programming, where the rubber hits the road.

I share the knowledge that comes from tinkering and practice.  
From solving real problems and trying different solutions to see what works and what doesn't work.



Enjoy the ride and happy brewing!
