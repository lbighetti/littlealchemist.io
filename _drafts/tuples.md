Elixir - What are these Tuples Schmuples anyway ? And Atoms ? Atomic Tuplewares ?
or The Atomic Tuppleware - a brief tale about Tuples and Atoms.

In Elixir there is a data structure called Tupple. What a funky name. Reminds me of tupperware. There is also a data type called Atom. Let's go over what they are, how they're used in Elixir and why they're powerful.

## Chapter 1: Tuples.

I was watching a video from JosÃ© Valim at Pluralsight, and I heard him say that a function would return a __Tuple__.

I had never heard that word before.

Tuple.

TuppleTuppleTupple.

Ha!

It's  a funky name isn't it ?

There is a weird sound to it.

_TUPLE._

Anyway he went on to show something really cool.  
The function he was mentioning returning something like this:

```elixir
{:ok, result}
```

Okay, I thought, that looks interesting.  
It's like you have this __first piece__ which tells you __if the outcome was good or bad__, _and then_ you get your so desired result.

Similarly, the function could otherwise return:

```elixir
{:error, reason}
```

Damn, neat!  
Isn't it ?

But then... he said the first item was an __atom__.

Atom ?
__An ATOM?__

__What the hell is an atom ??__

I mean, I know what an atom is, but I'm guessing this isn't the kind that has electrons and neutrons.

## Chapter 2: Atoms

I went to Elixir website:

>Atoms are constants where their name is their own value. Some other languages call these symbols.

```elixir
iex> :hello
:hello
iex> :hello == :world
false
```

>The booleans true and false are, in fact, atoms:

```elixir
iex> true == :true
true
iex> is_atom(false)
true
iex> is_boolean(:false)
true
```

Ah!
Ok, so, atoms are like symbols.
__Symbols that carry a meaning.__  
And the Erlang virtual machine only keeps 1 copy of each atom in memory.

They are especially useful when used mostly internally in your application but not necessarily printed.  
So instead of saying your function went `"ok"` as a string, you say that it went `:ok`, as an atom.

This is probably natural for Rubists but me coming from Javaland it was totally alien.

`:ok`, back to the __tuples__.

## Back to Chapter 1: Tuplewares

Right, so, now I get what `:ok` and `:error` are supposed to do there.  
The first item on the tuple tells me what happened, and the second gives me the details.

But let's talk about the tuples a little more.

What are Tuples?  
__Tuples are a collection of values.__  
They typically come in the size of 2 or 3 items, so small, not your collection to store life stories and your bank statement, but more of like summary information.

The way I showed you, is one of the most common ways it is used in Elixir.

```elixir
{:status_atom, your_stuff}
```

And what do functional programmers do ?

That's right.

We Pattern Match!!  
By the way check out my [Pattern Matching post](<<link>>) if you haven't yet.  
Go, I'll wait.

Now, let's say this function that returned the tuple is called like `your_function(argument)`.

Typically we would then do something like this:

```elixir
case your_function(argument) do
	{:ok,  result} ->
		# do successful stuff
	{:error, reason} ->
		# do erroneous stuff
end
```

Damn.  
Tell me that's not beautiful.

It's no the only way that this is used though.  
Another example would be something like the Ecto.update_all/3

This function returns a tuple also, but it's a little different.  
This function is updating several rows ina a database, so what the return tuple gives is `{rows_affected, output}`, and if there is no output, it simply comes `nil`.

So if you updated there and you updated 57 rows, and the database returned no output, it would throw you this:

```elixir
{57, nil}
```

Again, loyal.  
Properly saluted!

## Epilogue

So that's my brief memoir of Tuples and Atoms.
