The name is __Leandro Bighetti.__

I blog about my experiences learning Elixir, the Phoenix framework, functional programming and everything that comes along with it.

I also share my experiences of when things went terribly wrong and bust,  
what I like to call _Programming Unknowledge_.

There are many possible ways to do things right in programming, and I hope to show you some of them here.

But how to screw things up - that is pretty universal, and I will surely give you detailed guide.

I hope you enjoy,
happy brewing!
